### ADEL: Automated Drop-cast Electrode Setup for High-throughput Screening of Battery Materials



This repository contains ten folders with the following contents:


- `1_Video_ADEL_Setup`: A video of ADEL setup while running showing the steps of the drop-cast electrode preparation.

- `2_Planes_3D-printed-key-componets`: The planes of the 3D printed key components used for the setup are listed in this folder.

- `3_3D-printed-key-componets`: This folder contains the 3D design of each key component, which could be directly 3D printed to reproduce the work.

-  `4_Viscosity_Evaluation`: the raw data of the viscosity test to measure the rheological behavior of the Glycerin/water mixtures and the slurry are provided.

-  `5_Illumination_test`: the processed data of the illumination test of the infrared lamp and the halogen lamp are provided.

-  `6_Dr-Blade_vs_ADEL_NMC-data`: the raw data of the electrochemical measurement of NMC-532 material prepared by the traditional Dr. Blade method vs ADEL method.

-  `7_Drying_Optimization_NMC-data`: the raw data of the electrochemical measurement of NMC-532 material using different drying methods: vacuum oven, heating plate, infrared lamp, and halogen lamp.

-  `8_Slurry-Reproducibility_NMC`: the raw data of the electrochemical measurement of NMC-532 material for the slurry reproducibility test at different C rates prepared by ADEL module.

-  `9_Electrode-Reproducibility_NMC`: the raw data of the electrochemical measurement of NMC-532 material for the electrode reproducibility test at different C rates prepared by ADEL module.

-  `10_Module-Versatility_data`: the raw data of the electrochemical measurement of the materials used for the versatility test at different C rates prepared by ADEL module.
